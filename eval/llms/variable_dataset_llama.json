Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic and geographic attributes among counties along with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim is to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation with the distribution of the capacity of healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease infection and spread. The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles (S), confirmed infections (I), hospitalized and ICU admitted (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes lio residing in the county. In the second scenario, we used the model to generate projections of the impact of potential easing on the non-pharmaceutical interventions in the critical care capacity of each county in Ohio. We assessed the impact of 50% reduction on the estimated impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing the hazard rate of infection. Under this scenario we calculated the proportion of ICU ",

So far, the new virus has infected more than 31,000 people and killed at least 636 of them (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). While considerable progrenter of the current coronavirus outbreak, announced the implementation of travel restriction as strategy for controlling the infection. Following this announcement, many other cities and provinces ofChina decided to enforce similar measures. In the meantime, many other control measures have been adopted, like convincing all the residents to stay at home and avoid contacts as much as possible. From the mathematical point of view, this can significantly contribute to decreasing the contact rate c among the persons. On the other hand, also from January 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing numbers of 2019-nCoV testing kits were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, gradually shortening the time period of diagnosis (i.e. the value of dI increases greatly).

Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our s type of interaction substitution is equivalent to assuming an effective contact rate ratio of 1 + \u03b1 for recovered individuals relative to the rest of the population.

This scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate IL s. It was simulated by randomly choosing agents A 1 with probability IL\u21900.5 to stay at home. Observing the results in Fig. 9, although the I t curve is flattened when compared with scenarios B and 4, it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3. Notice the D t still grows exponentially before reaching the peak. For the economic perspective, this scenario be- haves similarly to the baseline. These metrics offer evidence that IL\u21900.5 is not enough for effective epidemiological control, and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended.

We developed DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model for predicting detected cases and deaths in the prevaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model allows for underdetection of infections and effects of government interventions.We have applied DELPHI across more than 200 geographical areas since early April 2020 and recorded 6% and 11% two-week, out-of-sample median mean absolute percentage error on predicting cases and deaths, respectively. DELPHI compares favorably with other top COVID-19 epidemiological models and predicted in 2020 the large-scale epidemics in many areas, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia, months in advance. We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions. First, we quantify the impact of government interventions on the pandemic's spread. We predict, that in the absence of any interventions, more than 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17, 2020, whereas 280,000 deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world had started one week earlier. Furthermore, we find that mass gathering restrictions and school closings were associated with the largest average reductions in infection rates at 29:9 6 6:9% and 17:3 6 6:7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay at home, was associated with an average reduction in infection rate by 74:4 6 3:7% from baseline across countries that implemented it. In the second appl",

This implies a fixed probability of death equal \u02dc\u03c4 to \u03bd+\u02dc\u03c4. By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)\u00b5 from the transition rates in the decline of infection rate. The exponential term models a potential resurgence in cases, for instance, due to premature relaxation of societal restrictions or some change in behavior. In (1), parameters (cid:1)t0 and (cid:1) k control the timing of such measures and the rapidity of their penetration, (cid:1) whereas the (cid:1)c, (cid:6)tjump, d controls the timing, magnitude, and duration of a resurgence. In Section 4.1, we explain that (1) forms the basis for modeling a wide variety of policies as the composite of elemental interventions, such as including social distancing, school closings, and stay-at-home orders. 2.4. Implementation and Availability DELPHI was created in early April 2020 and has been continuously updated to reflect new observed data. The codebase is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ COVIDAnalytics/DELPHI), with the primary model written in Python 3.7 using the of Recovery and Deaths DELPHI's compartmental structure allows for different transition rates for recovery and death processes \u2212 dI dt (cid:2) \u2212(\u03bd + (cid:1)\u03c4)I, where \u03bd is the rate of recovery and \u03c4 is the rate of death.

The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths.

However, with respect to COVID-19, many authors instead define Re to include the effects of interventions, due to the implications that Re = 1 has for epidemic control.

The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R0. The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge\u2013Kutta methods. Results: We found an R0of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures.

In this model we take the constants\u03b11and\u03b12 to be reciprocal of the frequency with which individuals acquires the COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively. In Fig. 2 the model shows that when \u03b11 = 0.05 i.e. there is a high risk of getting infected by a contaminated environment, as compared to an infected individual, the number of exposed, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals increases. However, when \u03b12 = 0.05 i.e. higher chances of getting infected by an individual, as compared to a contaminated environment. Moreover, in Fig. 2c the number of susceptible vanishes by the 23rd day for \u03b12 = 0.05 since many people were infected quite rapidly, see Fig. 2d\u2013f for duration 0 \u2212 20 days. Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for \u03b12 = 0.05, as compared to when \u03b11 = 0.05 and \u03b12 = 0.1.

A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision- and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak m",

The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4). Two other scenarios looked at mild restrictions from the start (25%) or relaxation of restrictions before summer (to 30%); both predicted a rapidly increasing epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively).

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020.

Some countries, such as, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the detection method and has a delay between the real infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used to model the flows of people between four possible states: S=S\u00f0t\u00de, the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U \u00f0t\u00de, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=Q\u00f0t\u00de, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=C\u00f0t\u00de, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics. Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable I\u00f0t\u00de=U \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe Q\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe C\u00f0t\u00de, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals at time t. The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C=I is less than 1 and time-varying. R, the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system. The model comprises the following independent parameters: \u03b1 is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined infected per day. \u03b1\u2208[0,1\u00de. g1 is the quarantine rate for an un-quarantined infected \u2208[0,1].

Sensitivity analysis As we saw in Secters can be found, e.g., in Aguilar et al. [19]. Note that the sensitivity index may depend on several param- eters of the system, but also can be constant, independent of any parameter. For example, \u03d2 R 0 \u03b8 = +1 means that increasing (decreas- ing) \u03b8 by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R 0 by that same percentage. The estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done, since a small ",

The starting point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities informed about the new virus [20], with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease. Only on January 20, we have the report [21], with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7, re- spectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5]. We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be pre- cise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020). The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a restriction of movements of in- dividuals due to quarantine in the city. As a consequence, there was a limitation on the spread of the disease. In agreement, in our model we consider, as the total population under study, N= 110 0 0 0 0 0 / 250. This denominator has been determined in the first days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value: according to the real data published by the WHO, it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individu- als. As for the initial conditions, the following values have been fixed: S 0 = N \u2212 6, E 0 = 0, I 0 = 1, P 0 = 5, A 0 = 0, H 0=0, R 0 = 0, and F 0 = 0.

In Fig. 6 (a), we see that a combination of a 10% reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90% increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks, force the newly diagnosed cases to decline, and significantly shorten the duration of the epidemic. 7. Potential of a second outbreak in Wuhan after the return-to-work With newly diagnosed cases on the decline in Wuhan and other cities in China since February 14, an urgent task for the authorities is to decide when to allow people to go back to work. Without lifting the ban on traffic in and out of the city, we tested three hypotheses of allowing people to rex models may not necessarily be more reliable in making predictions due to the larger number of model parameters to be estimated. Using a simple SIR model and the dataset of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan for model calibration, we demonstrated that there is a linkage between the transmission rate b and the case-infection ratio r, which resulted in a continuum of best-fit parameter values, which can produce significantly different model predictions of the epidemic.

[5] Here, Ic(t) is the cumulative number of infections that have occurred up to time t, and N is the total population size. This version of the branching process model, referred to as HawkesN, represents a stochastic version of the SIR model; with large R, the results of HawkesN are essentially deterministic. When projecting, we use our estimated R(ti ) at the last known point for all times going forward. Since the Nt term is the number of infections, if our estimates for R(ti ) are based on mortality numbers, we must also choose a mortality rate to interpolate between the two counts; although existing estimated rates vary significantly, we choos including spread of Ebola (26), retaliatory gang crimes (27), and email traffic (28, 29). The intensity (rate) of infections can be modeled as \u03bb(t) = \u00b5 + (cid:88) ti <t R(ti )w (t \u2212 ti ), [1] where t is the current time and ti are the times of previous infection incidents. Here, the dimensionless reproduction number, R(t), evolves in time (18, 30\u201333) to reflect changes in disease reproduction in response to public health interventions (e.g., school closings, social distancing, closures of nonessential businesses, isolation, and quarantine).

The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximancing measures, including bans on public events, school closures, and quarantine and isolation measures. The SIR model can be fit to the predictions made in ref. 3 for agent-based simulations of the United States. The SIR model assumes a population of size N where S is the total number of susceptible individuals, I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of resistant individuals. For simplicity of modeling, we view deaths as a subset of resistant individuals, and deaths can be estimated from the dynamics of R; this is reasonable for a disease with a relatively small death rared with the overall population size (35). Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti \u2212 tj )/\u03bb(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j.

After the surge in infections, the model asymptotes to an end state in which r approaches the end value r\u221e and s approaches 1 \u2212 r\u221e and the infected population approaches 0. The value r\u221e satisfies a well-known transcendental equation (46\u201348). A phase diagram of the universal solutions for several R0 values is shown in Fig. 2, Upper Right. The dynamics start in the bottom right corner where s is almost 1 and follow the colored line to terminate on the i = 0 axis at the value s\u221e. A rigorous derivation of the limiting state under the assumptions here can be found in refs. 46\u201348. Under the SIR (and similar) model(s), if R0 is decreased during the middle of the population. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we present scenarios of no social distancing vs. short-term social distancing with parameters from Table 1 for death data up through the end of March, fit to the SIR model. We caution that the goal of these scenarios is not to produce highly accurate percentages but rather, to present scenarios under different basic assumptions that illustrate the usefulness of social distancing measures and the potential danger in easing them too soon. For the New York state scenario, with R0 presumed to decrease by a factor of two with distancing measures, the outbreak is not completely controlled by distancing, and the number of infections continues to rise to approximately 10% by mid-April. In contrast, without distancing measures the scenario shows four times that number of infected individuals by midApril, a level that would have represented a potentially disastrous Bertozzi et al.

Figure 1 shows an example of such logistic function, where for the case of Singapore, we set t0 = 89, since the policy of compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case was uncovered. This model is used in both Scenarios 1 and 3. Figure 1. Logistic function to model the infection rate due to compulsory mask wearing m(t) for Scenarios 1 and 3. To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy. Figure 2 illustrates one such example, where we have \u03b2nc = 0.5 and t1 = 154, taken in context to Singapore's shift from a full lockdown to gradual resumption of everyday activities 154 days after the first case. The infection rate \u03b2nc is expected to be lower than \u03b2s as even with the complacency and fatigue, as there is now a greater situational awareness of the severity and the population in general will take a more cautious outloo",

According to our estimations, five countries have reached a second phase with R0 < 1, meaning that the epidemic is under control and converging to an equilibrium. On the other hand, the USA have also reached a second stage with a lower R0, but still higher than 1, indicating that the number of infections is decelerating but is not under control yet. A \u03b4I value higher than \u03b4H was to be expected, indicating a lower rate of mortality in hospitalized patients. However, that was observed only in the USA. In the other countries in this study, the value of \u03b4H is higher or very similar to the value of \u03b4I. In these cases, this behavior might be justified by the most critical cases being treated in the hospitals, therefore being associated to a higher mortality rate. It is interesting to remark that the predictions of the number of deceased in Germany in Fig 6 and the USA in Fig 7 presented a larger mismatch both as compared to the other countries as well as compared to the number of cases within Germany and the USA themselves.

These predictions are consistent with Ontario statistics (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table).

The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the interactions and competition shown in Fig. 2b. The model predicts that by the end of 2021, about 680 K people would have been infected, half of whom are asymptomatic. The cumulative infection curves exhibit the steepest rise in December 2020 and March 2021, corresponding to the two peaks in the new case counts. By the end of 2021, 71% of the Ontario population would have been vaccinated with at least one dose, with 57% fully vaccinated (Fig. 2c). At that time, 11 K would have died from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig. 2d). The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750 K infections and 10.2 K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig. 3. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig. 3a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig. 3b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig. 3d).

Who are getting infected by the Delta variant, and who are the carriers? Interestingly, while the wild-type infectio gain insights, we simulate a dangerous hypothetical variant, which we refer to as \"Neos.\" Neos is designed to be deadlier by increasing its (i) infectivity (14% higher than the Delta variant), (ii) vaccine escape rate (70% for one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca, similar to Delta which is 67%; 25% and 50% for two doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, respectively; compared to 12% and 40% for Delta), and (iii) fraction of asymptomatic infections (55% instead of 50%).

Results are obtained for three scenarios: (a1) more stringent NPI, with mobility decreased further by 40% starting September 1 2021; (b1) a third vaccine booster that offers twice the protection of health conditions. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity likely has a significant impact on the spread of infections. As can be seen in the geographical heterogeneity in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, socio-economic factors also play an important role in the local spread of COVID-19. These factors include the number of people per household, job locations, frequency of public transportation usage, regional vaccination rates, and social connectedness, etc. Different socio-economic groups are likely affected differently by the NPI. Thus, a worthwhile extension would be to divide Ontario into regions with distinct demographics, represent the spread of COVID-19 within each region using an incarnation of the SV2(AIR)3 model, and then loosely connect these sub-models based on the estimated amounts of communications mediated by job or social travels. The present model is formulated using data from Ontario, Canada (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Geographical and socio-economic parameters can be refitted to simulate VOC dynamics in a different province in Canada or a different country (e.g., infectivity \u03b2, vaccine type \u03b5, COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcX, NPI \u03bb).

We suggest that the difference in settling depths between our 2009 and 2014 simulations is a consequence of the N2 peak at around 350 m that was present in 2009 but not in2014: the meltwater was ''trapped'' by the local maximum in stratification. This illustrates an important point: localized variability in the ambient stratification N(z) can have a substantial effect on mass loss due to melt (see text). On top of the distributions we plot the settling depths predicted by the simple scaling relationships (dashed) and the one-dimensional line plume model (solid) with a 5 2.6: both show excellent agreement with the highresolution simulations. The new scaling relationships show substantial improvement over the scaling relationships for point source plumes [h } (F/N3)1/4]. For the scaling solution, we have used a 5 2.6: the good agreement with the simulation results indicates that the coefficient matches that for point source plumes (Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tom\u00e0s et al. 2016). c.

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE.

We infer the model parameters based on the official data (source: Protezione Civile and Ministero della Salute) about the evolution of the epidemic in Italy from 20 February 2020 (day 1) through 5 April 2020 (day 46). The official data we gathered are provided in Supplementary Table 1. We turn the data into fractions over the whole Italian population (~60 million). The estimated parameter values are based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by policymakers. In particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set as: I = 200/60e6, D = 20/60e6, A = 1/60e6, R = 2/60e6, T = 0, H = 0, E = 0; S = 1 \u2013 I \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 T \u2013 H \u2013 E. The parameters are set as \u03b1 = 0.570, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.011, \u03b3 = 0.456, \u03b5 = 0.171, \u03b8 = 0.371, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.125, \u03bc = 0.017, \u03bd = 0.027, \u03c4 = 0.01, \u03bb = \u03c1 = 0.034 and \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. The resulting basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.38. After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set \u03b1 = 0.422, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.0057 and \u03b3 = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set \u03b5 = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence \u03b5 is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 \u03b1 = 0.360, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.005 and \u03b3 = 0.200; also, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.034, \u03bc = 0.008, \u03bd = 0.015, \u03bb = 0.08 and \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017.

Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g, the model predicts an evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected in more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing countermeasures, able to yield \u03b1 = 0.200 and \u03b3 = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in the long term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when the initially affected population is a small fraction. Social-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions. Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment",
