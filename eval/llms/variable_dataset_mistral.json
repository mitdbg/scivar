Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic and geographic attributes among counties along with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim is to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation with the distribution of the capacity of healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease infection and spread. The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles (S), confirmed infections (I), hospitalized and ICU admitted (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes lio residing in the county. In the second scenario, we used the model to generate projections of the impact of potential easing on the non-pharmaceutical interventions in the critical care capacity of each county in Ohio. We assessed the impact of 50% reduction on the estimated impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing the hazard rate of infection. Under this scenario we calculated the proportion of ICU ",

While considerable progrenter of the current coronavirus outbreak, announced the implementation of travel restriction as strategy for controlling the infection. Following this announcement, many other cities and provinces ofChina decided to enforce similar measures.

Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our s type of interaction substitution is equivalent to assuming an effective contact rate ratio of 1 + \u03b1 for recovered individuals relative to the rest of the population.

It is a variant of the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model, which describes the dynamics of the fractions of susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals in a population. The model includes an additional parameter, \u03b1, which represents the contact rate ratio for recovered individuals relative to the rest of the population.

The text describes a table from a scientific study published in the journal Chaos, Solitons and Fractals. The table shows the income distribution in a country, with the percentage of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) going to each quintile of the population, from the most poor to the most rich. The data in the table is adapted from the World Bank. The authors of the study are P.C.L. Silva, P.V.C. Batista, and H.S. Lima. The table is called \"Income distribution\" and has columns labeled \"Social Stratum\" and \"% of GDP Share,\" and rows labeled \"Q1,\" \"Q2,\" \"Q3,\" \"Q4,\" \"Q5,\" \"Most Poor,\" \"Poor,\" \"Working Class,\" \"Rich,\" and \"Most Rich.\" The values in the table represent the percentage of the country's GDP that goes to each social stratum. The last two columns in the table are blank."

The GDP indicates a recession chart where the population ( A 1) and government ( A 4) is losing wealth and the businesses ( A 3) are floating at the equi- librium point (when the incomes and expenses are equal). Initially the A 3 are profiting but, in the accounting day, the profits are set- tled by the labor and tax expenses. The baseline scenario is con- sistent with the economic predictions of stagnation in Brazil. 5.2.

This scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate IL s. It was simulated by randomly choosing agents A 1 with probability IL\u21900.5 to stay at home. Observing the results in Fig. 9, although the I t curve is flattened when compared with scenarios B and 4, it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3. Notice the D t still grows exponentially before reaching the peak. For the economic perspective, this scenario be- haves similarly to the baseline. These metrics offer evidence that IL\u21900.5 is not enough for effective epidemiological control, and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended. The impact of different isolation levels can be seen in Figs. 10 and 11, for IL \u2208 [0.3, 0.9], which represents the response of epi- demiological and economical curves for increasing IL. In Fig. 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve It flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown. Fig. 11 shows that as the value of IL increases, wealth loss of the A3 agents is higher, represented by W A 3 S,t curve, This scenario represents the pol- icy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing, but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agents.

We developed DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model for predicting detected cases and deaths in the prevaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model allows for underdetection of infections and effects of government interventions.We have applied DELPHI across more than 200 geographical areas since early April 2020 and recorded 6% and 11% two-week, out-of-sample median mean absolute percentage error on predicting cases and deaths, respectively. DELPHI compares favorably with other top COVID-19 epidemiological models and predicted in 2020 the large-scale epidemics in many areas, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia, months in advance. We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions. First, we quantify the impact of government interventions on the pandemic's spread. We predict, that in the absence of any interventions, more than 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17, 2020, whereas 280,000 deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world had started one week earlier. Furthermore, we find that mass gathering restrictions and school closings were associated with the largest average reductions in infection rates at 29:9 6 6:9% and 17:3 6 6:7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay at home, was associated with an average reduction in infection rate by 74:4 6 3:7% from baseline across countries that implemented it. In the second appl",

The exponential term models a potential resurgence in cases, for instance, due to premature relaxation of societal restrictions or some change in behavior. In (1), parameters (cid:1)t0 and (cid:1) k control the timing of such measures and the rapidity of their penetration, (cid:1) whereas the (cid:1)c, (cid:6)tjump, d controls the timing, magnitude, and duration of a resurgence.

The model uses a compartmental structure, which divides the population into several compartments based on their disease status. The compartments include susceptible individuals (cid:4), infected individuals (cid:2), recovered individuals (cid:3), and removed individuals (cid:5). The model also includes parameters for the rates of recovery (d, \u03bd) and death (\u03c4).\n\nThe text discusses two different ways of modeling the recovery and death processes. In the first approach, the recovery and death rates are combined into a single term, implying a fixed probability of death relative to recovery. In the second approach, the probability of death and the transition rates for recovery and death are decoupled.\n\nThe text also mentions the implementation of DELPHI and its availability on GitHub. It describes how DELPHI models different phases of government response during a pandemic and provides examples of studies that have used DELPHI to model specific cities and counties.\n\nThere are several variables and parameters mentioned in the text.

Modeling Effect of Increasing Government Response As shown in Figure 2, DELPHI models different phases for the government response during a pandemic by means of the area-specific function \u03b3(t) for other reasons (e.g., to avoid losing time from work). Although in reality, the likelihood that a patient will be identified through testing varies across areas and over time, DEL- PHI treats the probability of detection, pd, as a global constant nuisance parameter. The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents average estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area.

For both periods, DELPHI seems to predict the epidemic progression relatively well in most areas, with < 10% MAPE on reported cases and < 15% MAPE on reported deaths. The worldwide median MAPE was 5.8% for detected cases and 10.6% for deaths. The areas with the highest MAPE were typically those with the fewest deaths, as shown in the selected examples in Table 2. Analogously, the median RMSE for deaths in both periods was <100 across all regions, which is remarkable given that the RMSE is not scaled by the observed number of deaths and the high number of deaths per region (e.g., by the second period, a majority of areas in North America and Europe were reporting more than 5,000 cumulative deaths).

The results for Russia and the United Kingdom are consistent with the overall performances across all countries of all regions, as described extensively in the rest of the section. Concretely, the graphs suggest that DELPHI achieves strong prediconsistently predicting, with high accuracy, the overall spread of the disease for several weeks across regions with different epidemiological characteristics. Notably, DELPHI was able to anticipate, as early as April 17, the dynamics of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (resp. Russia) up to May 12.

Covasim can also model the effect of comorbidities, which act by modifying an individual's probability of developing severe symptoms (and hence critical symptoms and death).

Age-linked disease susceptibility, progression, and mortality probabilities. Key: rsus: relative susceptibility to infection; psym: probability of developing symptoms; psev: probability of developing severe symptoms (i.e., sufficient to justify hospitalization); pcri: probability of developing into a critical case (i.e., sufficient to require ICU); pdea: probability of death (i.e., infection fatality ratio). Relative susceptibility values are derived from odds ratios presented in Zhang et al. [47]. Mortality rates are based on O'Driscoll et al. [50], which did not differentiate 80\u201389 and 90+. Values were validated from model fits to data on numbers of cases, numbers of people hospitalized and in intensive care, and numbers of deaths from Washington and Oregon states. Note that \"overall\" values depend on the age structure of the population being modeled. For a population like the USA or UK, the symptomatic proportion is roughly 70%, while for populations skewed towards younger ages, this proportion is lower.

For example, several methods are implemented to compute the effective reproduction number Re. Numerous definitions of Re exist; in standard SIR modeling, the most common definition (\"method 1\") is [72]: Re \u00e0 R0S=N where R0 is the basic reproduction number, S is the number of susceptibles, and N is the total population size. However, with respect to COVID-19, many authors instead define Re to include the effects of interventions, due to the implications that Re = 1 has for epidemic control. A second common definition of Re (\"method 2\") is to first determine the total number of people who became infectious on day t, then count the total number of people these pe compared. Covasim also includes an estimate of the epidemic doubling time, computed similarly to the \"rule of 69.3\" [74], specifically: T \u00e0 2 wlog \u00d6 \u00dc =ni\u00d6 t t \u00dc ni\u00d6 \u00d6 where T is the doubling time, w is the window length over which to compute the doubling time (3 days by default), and ni(t) is the cumulative number of infections at time t. log \u00dc\u00dc \u0000 w 2.6.7 Analyzers.

The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R0. The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge\u2013Kutta methods. Results: We found an R0of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures. Results after simulating various scenarios indicate that disregarding social distancing androme coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan[1], a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019.

A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

Before the Chinese New Year (25 January 2020), there were lots of annual summing-up meetings and/or parties, with higher than usual close contacts, leading to a higher likelihood of infection transmission than that of the earlier periods covereduring periods comparable with ours reported similar findings in terms of a high basic reproduction number (for instance, Reference [29], where authors, using an exponential growth method, computed a basic reproduction number of 6.11 (95% CI 4.51\u20138.16), assuming no changes in reporting rate and with a serial interval of 8.4 \u00b1 3.8 days).

Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4).

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 inWuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

Some countries, such as, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the detection method and has a delay between the real infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used to model the flows of people between four possible states: S=S\u00f0t\u00de, the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U \u00f0t\u00de, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=Q\u00f0t\u00de, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=C\u00f0t\u00de, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics. Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable I\u00f0t\u00de=U \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe Q\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe C\u00f0t\u00de, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals at time t. The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C=I is less than 1 and time-varying. R, the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system. The model comprises the following independent parameters: \u03b1 is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined infected per day. \u03b1\u2208[0,1\u00de. g1 is the quarantine rate for an un-quarantined infected \u2208[0,1].

The parameters represent various rates and proportions.\n\nThe model includes the following variables:\n\n* S: susceptible class\n* E: exposed class\n* I: symptomatic and infectious class\n* P: super-spreaders class\n* A: infectious but asymptomatic class\n* H: hospitalized class\n* R: recovery class\n* F: fatality class\n\nThe model includes the following parameters:\n\n* \u03b2: human-to-human transmission coefficient per unit time (days) per person\n* \u03b2 (cid:3): a high transmission coefficient due to super-spreaders\n* l: relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients\n* \u03ba: rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious\n* \u03c11: proportion of progression from exposed class to susceptible class\n* \u03c12: proportion of progression from exposed class to infectious but asymptomatic class\n* \u03b3a: recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals\n* \u03b3i: recovery rate of symptomatic individuals\n* \u03b3r: recovery rate of hospitalized patients\n* \u03b4i: disease induced death rate due to infected individuals\n* \u03b4p: disease induced death rate due to super-spreaders\n* \u03b4h: disease induced death rate due to hospitalized individuals\n* N: total population size\n\nThe model equations are given by (1) in the text. The first line of the equation describes the change in the susceptible class (S) due to new infections from the infectious class (I) and the hospitalized class (H), and the loss of susceptible individuals due to becoming infected or recovering. The second line describes the change in the hospitalized class (H) due to new hospitalizations from the symptomatic and infectious class (I) and the super-spreaders class (P), and the loss of hospitalized individuals due to recovery or death. The remaining lines describe the changes in the other classes.\n\nThe model assumes that the total population size (N) is constant, and the sum of the population sizes of all classes is equal to N. The model also assumes that the transmission of the disease occurs through human-to-human contact, and that super-spreaders and hospitalized individuals have a higher transmission rate than non-hospitalized individuals. The model accounts for the progression of individuals from the exposed class to different infectious classes, as well as the recovery and death rates for each class."

The equilibrium is given by (N, 0, 0), where N is the total population size. The stability of this equilibrium depends on the value of R\u2080, which is the basic reproduction number of the disease. If R\u2080 < 1, the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, meaning that small perturbations to the population will not cause the disease to spread. If R\u2080 > 1, the disease free equilibrium is unstable, and the disease will eventually spread through the population.\n\nThe text also provides sensitivity indices for R\u2080 with respect to various parameters. These indices measure the relative change in R\u2080 for a given percentage change in a parameter value. The parameters and their corresponding sensitivity indices are:\n\n\u03b2 | transmission rate | \u03b2\u2081 (\u03b2\u2082) | recovery rate of class I (II) | \u03ba (\u03c1\u2081) | death rate of class I (II) | \u03b3a | birth rate | \u03b3i | immigration rate of class I | \u03b3r | recovery rate of class R | \u03b4i | death rate of class I due to disease | \u03b4p | death rate of class P due to disease | \u03b4h | death rate of class H due to disease\n\nThe sensitivity indices are given in the text as:\n\n\u03b2l | 0.941 | \u03ba | 0.059 | \u03c11 | 0.418 | \u03b3a | None | \u03b3i | -0.061 | \u03b3r | -0.395 | \u03b4i | -0.699 | \u03b4p | -0.027 | \u03b4h | -0.238\n\n\u03b2\u2082 | 0.418 | \u03b2 | 0.059 | \u03c1\u2082 | None | \u03b3a | None | \u03b3i | -0.238 | \u03b3r | -0.699 | \u03b4i | -0.395 | \u03b4p | 0.941 | \u03b4h | 0.059\n\nThese sensitivity indices indicate that the transmission rate (\u03b2) and the recovery rate of class II (\u03b2\u2082) have the greatest impact on R\u2080, with a 1% change in these parameters leading to a 0.941% and 0.418% change in R\u2080, respectively. The death rates of classes I and II (\u03ba and \u03c1\u2081) also have significant impacts on R\u2080, with a 1% change in these parameters leading to a 0.418% and 0.699% change in R\u2080, respectively. The birth rate (\u03b3a) and the recovery rate of class R (\u03b3r) have the largest negative impacts on R\u2080, with a 1% change in these parameters leading to a 0.395% and 0.699% decrease in R\u2080, respectively. The other parameters have smaller impacts on R\u2080."

Sensitivity analysis As we saw in Secters can be found, e.g., in Aguilar et al. [19]. Note that the sensitivity index may depend on several param- eters of the system, but also can be constant, independent of any parameter. For example, \u03d2 R 0 \u03b8 = +1 means that increasing (decreas- ing) \u03b8 by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R 0 by that same percentage. The estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done, since a small ",

The starting point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities informed about the new virus [20], with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease. Only on January 20, we have the report [21], with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7, re- spectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5]. We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be pre- cise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020). The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a restriction of movements of in- dividuals due to quarantine in the city. As a consequence, there was a limitation on the spread of the disease. In agreement, in our model we consider, as the total population under study, N= 110 0 0 0 0 0 / 250. This denominator has been determined in the first days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value: according to the real data published by the WHO, it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individu- als. As for the initial conditions, the following values have been fixed: S 0 = N \u2212 6, E 0 = 0, I 0 = 1, P 0 = 5, A 0 = 0, H 0=0, R 0 = 0, and F 0 = 0.

The dynamic reproduction number R(t) can then be estimated via expectation\u2013maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (17) using an expectation\u2013maximization algorithm (18). Public health measures undertaken in China appear to have reduced R(t) to below the self-sustaining level of R = 1 by the middle of February. In Italy, public health measures brought the local value of R(t) down; as of early April, however, it remained above R = 1. The estimated reproduction number in the United States as a whole stood at around 2.5. The reproduction number, however, varies notably by location. This model can be adapted to capture the long-ter California and Indiana, possibly due to the larger amount of data, compared with mortality for which SIR is the best for all three states.

The value r\u221e satisfies a well-known transcendental equation (46\u201348). A phase diagram of the universal solutions for several R0 values is shown in Fig. 2, Upper Right. The dynamics start in the bottom right corner where s is almost 1 and follow the colored line to terminate on the i = 0 axis at the value s\u221e. A rigorous derivation of the limiting state under the assumptions here can be found in refs. 46\u201348. Under the SIR (and similar) model(s), if R0 is decreased during the middle of the population. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we present scenarios of no social distancing vs. short-term social distancing with parameters from Table 1 for death data up through the end of March, fit to the SIR model. We caution that the goal of these scenarios is not to produce highly accurate percentages but rather, to present scenarios under different basic assumptions that illustrate the usefulness of social distancing measures and the potential danger in easing them too soon. For the New York state scenario, with R0 presumed to decrease by a factor of two with distancing measures, the outbreak is not completely controlled by distancing, and the number of infections continues to rise to approximately 10% by mid-April. In contrast, without distancing measures the scenario shows four times that number of infected individuals by midApril, a level that would have represented a potentially disastrous Bertozzi et al.

Relationships:\n\nThe text describes a relationship between the Hawkes-N process and the SIR model. The SIR model is a compartment model used to describe the spread of infectious diseases, where the population is divided into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The Hawkes-N process is a point process model used to describe the occurrence of events in time, such as new infections or recoveries.\n\nThe text suggests that the Hawkes-N process can be related to the SIR model by considering a stochastic version of the SIR model, where a counting process Ic(t) tracks the total number of infections up to time t. The process satisfies the rates given by Eq. 6 in the text, which can be approximated as dI(t)/dt \u2248 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)I when S \u2248 N. This approximation leads to an exponential solution for I(t) when t is large compared to 1/\u03b3.\n\nThe text also suggests that at very early times, the recovery rate may lag behind the infection rate, resulting in a higher value for \u03b1 (the rate of change of infected individuals) compared to \u03b2 (the infection rate). However, the text does not provide a specific relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b2 at early times.\n\nIII. Conclusions:\n\nThe text describes the relationship between the Hawkes-N process and the SIR model, and suggests that the Hawkes-N process can be used to model the occurrence of new infections and recoveries in the context of the SIR model. The text also suggests that at very early times, the recovery rate may lag behind the infection rate, resulting in a higher value for \u03b1 compared to \u03b2. However, the text does not provide a specific relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b2 at early times.\n\nThe text also mentions that if the number of recoveries is negligible, the SIR model can be reduced to an exponential model. This means that the SIR model can be approximated as an exponential growth model when the recovery rate is much smaller than the infection rate.\n\nOverall, the text provides a useful overview of the relationship between the Hawkes-N process and the SIR model, and highlights the potential applications of the Hawkes-N process in modeling the spread of infectious diseases using the SIR model framework."

Figure 1 shows an example of such logistic function, where for the case of Singapore, we set t0 = 89, since the policy of compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case was uncovered. This model is used in both Scenarios 1 and 3. Figure 1. Logistic function to model the infection rate due to compulsory mask wearing m(t) for Scenarios 1 and 3.

This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy. Figure 2 illustrates one such example, where we have \u03b2nc = 0.5 and t1 = 154, taken in context to Singapore's shift from a full lockdown to gradual resumption of everyday activities 154 days after the first case.

Relating this to Singapore's context, compulsory mask wearing was introduced 89 days after the first case, hence this suggests that the introduction of compulsory mask wearing was timely to control the infection. Crucially, onder approximately 50 days. It is likely that for such cases of early enforcement, the Susceptible population remains very high throughout. Consequently, when the agents begin to flout the rules aftert1 = 154 days, the combination of both larger Susceptible compartment pool and higher \u03b2nc results in a greater amount of infection. In other words, the susceptible population must be sufficiently reduced before th gradual noncompliance.

B117 strained virus has acquired the D614G spike protein mutation, reportedly increasing its infectivity, with little difference to its lethality [24]. According to studies done in the UK, the R0 value of B117 has increased by up to 0.7 [25]. To investigate the impact of delay in public mask enforcement on controlling the Maximum Infected Numbers due to the B117 variant, we modelled a hypothetical scenario. In this scenario, the first case of COVID-19 detected in Singapore is of the B117 variant. We ran our simulation of the 3 scenarios described in the preceding sections with a new value of R0 reflecting that of B117. The resulting plots are shown in Figure 6 and 7.

It divides the population into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The model assumes that once a person recovers from the disease, they become immune and will not be susceptible to infection again. The model can be described by the following system of differential equations:\n\nds dt = \u2212\u03b2is N\ndi dt = \u03b2is N \u2212 \u03b3 i\ndr dt = \u03b3 i\n\nwhere s, i, and r represent the ratio of susceptible, infected, and recovered people in the population, respectively, and N represents their absolute sum. The transmission rate of the disease is denoted by \u03b2, and the recovery rate of infected people is denoted by \u03b3. The model is usually solved using differential equations. However, it can also be analyzed using agent-based techniques, particularly when considering a social network.\n\n| name                   | description

To represent the work activity, we propose a generic layer to connect people with ages from 18 to 59 years, i.e., 60% of the total population in the case of Brazil. There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer). An example of this layer is shown on Fig. 2(b), using n = 100. Although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus depends directly on the edge weights, which we discuss in-depth on Section 3.1.1.

On the other hand, the USA have also reached a second stage with a lower R0, but still higher than 1, indicating that the number of infections is decelerating but is not under control yet. A \u03b4I value higher than \u03b4H was to be expected, indicating a lower rate of mortality in hospitalized patients. However, that was observed only in the USA. In the other countries in this study, the value of \u03b4H is higher or very similar to the value of \u03b4I. In these cases, this behavior might be justified by the most critical cases being treated in the hospitals, therefore being associated to a higher mortality rate. It is interesting to remark that the predictions of the number of deceased in Germany in Fig 6 and the USA in Fig 7 presented a larger mismatch both as compared to the other countries as well as compared to the number of cases within Germany and the USA themselves.

The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the new infections are dominated by the Delta variant. These predictions are consistent with Ontario statistics (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). The consistency between model predictions and Ontario statistics before July 2021 can be attributed to the choice of model parameters, which were based on statistics available then. Model predictions for the second half of 2021 can be used to validation. The total number of infectely half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig. 3d\u2013g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig. 3h).

We refer to this model as a SV2(AIR)3 model, for its representation of two vaccine types (V2), asymptomatic infections (A), and three VOC (the power '3' refers to the three instantiations of each infected and recovered class). The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the interactions and competition shown in Fig. 2b. The model predicts that by the end of 2021, about 680 K people would have been infected, half of whom are asymptomatic. The cumulative infection curves exhibit the steepest rise in December 2020 and March 2021, corresponding to the two peaks in the new case counts. By the end of 2021, 71% of the Ontario population would have been vaccinated with at least one dose, with 57% fully vaccinated (Fig. 2c). At that time, 11 K would have died from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig. 2d). The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750 K infections and 10.2 K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig. 3. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig. 3a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig. 3b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig. 3d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig. 2a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for",

The model predicts the reduced NPI would accelerate the spread of Delta, such that by March 2022, the total number of Delta infections would be 50% higher than baseline (Fig. 7b). Who are getting infected by the Delta variant, and who are the carriers? Interestingly, while the wild-type infectio gain insights, we simulate a dangerous hypothetical variant, which we refer to as \"Neos.\" Neos is designed to be deadlier by increasing its (i) infectivity (14% higher than the Delta variant), (ii) vaccine escape rate (70% for one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca, similar to Delta which is 67%; 25% and 50% for two doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, respectively; compared to 12% and 40% for Delta), and (iii) fraction of asymptomatic infections (55% instead of 50%). Recovery rate, mortality rate, and other clinical features are assumed to be the same as the wild type. We assume that Neos emerges in the fall of 2021. The predicted population dynamics that describe its spread, from August 1 2021 to June 30 2022, is shown in Fig. 9. After its introduction, Neos quickly takes hold due to its high transmissivity, and by the end of 2021, it has overtaken Delta to account for the majority of new infections (Fig. 9c).

Results are obtained for three scenarios: (a1) more stringent NPI, with mobility decreased further by 40% starting September 1 2021; (b1) a third vaccine booster that offers twice the protection of health conditions. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity likely has a significant impact on the spread of infections. As can be seen in the geographical heterogeneity in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, socio-economic factors also play an important role in the local spread of COVID-19. These factors include the number of people per household, job locations, frequency of public transportation usage, regional vaccination rates, and social connectedness, etc. Different socio-economic groups are likely affected differently by the NPI. Thus, a worthwhile extension would be to divide Ontario into regions with distinct demographics, represent the spread of COVID-19 within each region using an incarnation of the SV2(AIR)3 model, and then loosely connect these sub-models based on the estimated amounts of communications mediated by job or social travels. The present model is formulated using data from Ontario, Canada (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Geographical and socio-economic parameters can be refitted to simulate VOC dynamics in a different province in Canada or a different country (e.g., infectivity \u03b2, vaccine type \u03b5, COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcX, NPI \u03bb).

The model includes variables for the total population size (X), the number of susceptible individuals (S), the number of susceptible individuals with a previous infection and immunity (SVR), the number of infected individuals (I), and the number of symptomatic infected individuals (IX). The model also includes constants for the rate of births and deaths (\u03bc), the rate of death due to infection for individuals in the susceptible class (\u03b7), the mean time an individual spends in the susceptible class before becoming infected or dying (M), the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected by one of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses (\u03b2X), and the rate at which recovered individuals become reinfected (\u03b1X). The text mentions three different SARS-CoV-2 viruses: wild-type (W), Alpha (A), and Delta (D). However, it does not provide numerical values for any of these variables or constants."

It mentions the susceptible population (S), individuals with sustained immunity (SVR), individuals with waning immunity (M class), and the vaccination rates for the original susceptible population (\u03c91) and for those who have received one dose (V1). It also mentions the Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) and AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccines, the fraction of Pfizer vaccines (\u03b5PZ), and the fraction of AstraZeneca vaccines (\u03b5AZ). The text also mentions the rates at which individuals vaccinated with one dose (\u03b7V1) and two doses (\u03b7V2) lose their immunity. It does not mention the total population size or the number of individuals in each category. It also mentions that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not distinguished in the model, and mixed vaccination is not represented."

The model includes classes for susceptible individuals (S), vaccinated individuals (M), symptomatically infected individuals (IX), and asymptomatically infected individuals (AX), as well as individuals with recovered immunity (SVR). The model also includes parameters for transmission rates (\u03b2X), asymptomatic infection rates (\u03b1X), and mortality rates (\u03bcX and \u03bc). The text describes how individuals move between these classes based on vaccination status, immunity loss, and infection.\n\n| name                   | description

These NPI reduce the transmissivity of COVID-19, and are represented by scaling all \u03b2X's and \u03b2X V,M's simultaneously by a NPI severity index \u03bb, where 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1. The time-varying function \u03bb is chosen in part based on Ontario COVID-19 lockdown timeline and Google mobility data, and in part to fit the predicted new case numbers against provincial data available prior to July 2021; the values of \u03bb for 2020\u20132021 are shown in Fig. S1.

Much of the total mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet stems from a small number of rapidly melting ice shelves; here, we focus on Pine Island Glacier, which is the source of a large fraction of the total mass loss (Rignot et al. 2019).

The meltwater outflow is idealized as a prescribed, constant buoyancy source applied to the bottom of the model domain. The real-world buoyancy source is a function of complex melting and mixing processes beneath the ice shelf, but for the purposes of this study, the focus is on treating it as a tunable parameter. The text also discusses the vertical scale of the buoyancy plume and the relationship between the buoyancy source, width, Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, and rise height.\n\nThe variables in the text are:\n\n* F: buoyancy source\n* L: width of buoyancy source\n* N: Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency\n* h: rise height\n* a: constant\n\nThe text does not provide numerical values for any of these variables. However, it does mention that F has units of m4 s-2 and L has units of km. Therefore, we can infer that F is a buoyancy source and L is the width of the buoyancy source. The text also mentions that N is the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency and h is the rise height, but no numerical values are provided for these variables. The text also mentions that a is a constant with a value of 2.6.\n\nTherefore, the variables and their descriptions and numerical values are:\n\nname | description | numerical value\n------------------\n\nF | buoyancy source | m4 s-2\nL | width of buoyancy source | km\nN | Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency | s m-1\nh | rise height | m\na | constant | 2.6"

We see the development of a strong zonal flow, consistent with observations of the outflow from beneath the Pine Island ice shelf. (b) The zonally averaged meltwater distribution and (c) the meridionally averaged meltwater distribution are also depicted. Distributions have been normalized to integrate to 1. The meltwater outflow is deflected to the west by the Coriolis force, and eventually reenters the domain at the eastern boundary. Our model domain follows the schematic in Fig. 1. The horizontal widths Ly and Lx are both set to 5 km, while the depth of the ice shelf front Lz is set equal to 400 m (approximately consistent with Pine Island Glacier; see Jenkins et al. 2010).

(2017), and has the opposite sign.

We suggest that the difference in settling depths between our 2009 and 2014 simulations is a consequence of the N2 peak at around 350 m that was present in 2009 but not in2014: the meltwater was ''trapped'' by the local maximum in stratification. This illustrates an important point: localized variability in the ambient stratification N(z) can have a substantial effect on mass loss due to melt (see text). On top of the distributions we plot the settling depths predicted by the simple scaling relationships (dashed) and the one-dimensional line plume model (solid) with a 5 2.6: both show excellent agreement with the highresolution simulations. The new scaling relationships show substantial improvement over the scaling relationships for point source plumes [h } (F/N3)1/4]. For the scaling solution, we have used a 5 2.6: the good agreement with the simulation results indicates that the coefficient matches that for point source plumes (Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tom\u00e0s et al. 2016). c.

In the buoyancy source region, the temperature changes at a rate given by equation (C1). Melting is spatially distributed throughout the ice-shelf cavity, and the meltwater that is released loses buoyancy as it ascends toward the ice-shelf front. If the meltwater plume carries a buoyancy flux F by the time it reaches the base of the ice shelf, the smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for that buoyancy flux would be achieved if all of the meltwater that enters the ice shelf at the base is buoyant and rises to the surface. This is an approximation, as some of the meltwater may mix with the surrounding water and lose buoyancy before reaching the surface.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for a given buoyancy flux F is given by:\n\nmass loss rate = F / (density difference between meltwater and surrounding water)\n\nwhere density difference is the difference between the density of meltwater and the density of the surrounding water. The density of meltwater is assumed to be constant at 1025 kg/m^3, and the density of the surrounding water is given by the equation of state for seawater:\n\ndensity = 1000 + \u03b1T\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the thermal expansion coefficient of seawater, and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for a given buoyancy flux F is:\n\nmass loss rate = F / (1025 - (1000 + \u03b1T))\n\nwhere F is the buoyancy flux, \u03b1 is the thermal expansion coefficient of seawater, and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius at the base of the ice shelf.\n\nThis equation can be used to calculate the smallest possible rate of mass loss for a given buoyancy flux and temperature. For example, if the buoyancy flux is 10^6 kg/m^2/s and the temperature at the base of the ice shelf is 0 degrees Celsius, the smallest possible rate of mass loss would be:\n\nmass loss rate = 10^6 / (1025 - (1000 + \u03b1 * 0)) = 10^6 / 1255 = 8.03 x 10^4 kg/m^2/s\n\nThis equation assumes that all of the meltwater that enters the ice shelf at the base is buoyant and rises to the surface, which is an approximation. In reality, some of the meltwater may mix with the surrounding water and lose buoyancy before reaching the surface, resulting in a larger actual rate of mass loss.\n\nIn summary, the variables in the text are:\n\nl | time constant for the ice shelf | 1/20 s\nf | Coriolis parameter | 0 24 s\nTr(y) | temperature at y position in the unstable restoring region | Linear gradient from 28C to 18C\nT | temperature in the buoyancy source region | None\ndT dt | rate of change of temperature in the buoyancy source region | (other terms) 1 l[Tr(y) 2 T]\nF | buoyancy flux | None\ndensity difference | difference between the density of meltwater and the density of the surrounding water | (1025 - (1000 + \u03b1T))\nmass loss rate | smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for a given buoyancy flux | F / (density difference)\n\u03b1 | thermal expansion coefficient of seawater | None\nT | temperature in degrees Celsius at the base of the ice shelf | None\n\nThe text describes an experiment involving the melting of an ice shelf and the resulting buoyancy flux and mass loss.

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing.

We can infer that they are cumulative variables that depend only on the other variables and their own initial conditions. The text also mentions that the system is positive, meaning that all state variables take non-negative values for t \u2265 0 if initialized at time 0 with non-negative values. The system is also compartmental and bilinear."

These parameters can be increased thanks to improved treatments and acquisition of immunity against the virus. Discussion on modeling choices. In the model, we omit the probability rate of becoming deceased. Given an initial condition S(0), I(0), D(0), A(0), R(0), T(0), H(0), E(0) summing to 1, we can show that the variables converge to an equilibrium (cid:31)S \u22650; (cid:31)I 0; (cid:31)D 0; (cid:31)A 0 \u00bc\u00bc \u00bc \u00bc 0; (cid:31)T \u00bc 0; (cid:31)H \u22650; (cid:31)E \u22650 LettersNATuRE MEDICINE",

It does mention that some of the parameters (\u03bb, \u03ba, \u03be, \u03c1, and \u03c3) can be increased thanks to improved treatments and acquisition of immunity against the virus, but it does not specify by how much they can be increased. Therefore, we cannot provide numerical values for these parameters.

We infer the model parameters based on the official data (source: Protezione Civile and Ministero della Salute) about the evolution of the epidemic in Italy from 20 February 2020 (day 1) through 5 April 2020 (day 46). The official data we gathered are provided in Supplementary Table 1. We turn the data into fractions over the whole Italian population (~60 million). The estimated parameter values are based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by policymakers. In particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set as: I = 200/60e6, D = 20/60e6, A = 1/60e6, R = 2/60e6, T = 0, H = 0, E = 0; S = 1 \u2013 I \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 T \u2013 H \u2013 E. The parameters are set as \u03b1 = 0.570, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.011, \u03b3 = 0.456, \u03b5 = 0.171, \u03b8 = 0.371, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.125, \u03bc = 0.017, \u03bd = 0.027, \u03c4 = 0.01, \u03bb = \u03c1 = 0.034 and \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. The resulting basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.38. After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set \u03b1 = 0.422, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.0057 and \u03b3 = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set \u03b5 = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence \u03b5 is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 \u03b1 = 0.360, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.005 and \u03b3 = 0.200; also, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.034, \u03bc = 0.008, \u03bd = 0.015, \u03bb = 0.08 and \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017.

The text mentions several scenarios with different values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5, but no numerical values are given for these parameters. The text also mentions the basic reproduction number (R0) and how it relates to the peak of the epidemic.\n\nBased on the context of the text, we can infer that:\n\n\u03b1 | infection rate | The rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\n\u03b2 | transmission rate | The rate at which infected individuals transmit the disease to other susceptible individuals.\n\u03b3 | recovery rate | The rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune to the disease.\n\u03b4 | death rate | The rate at which infected individuals die from the disease.\n\u03b5 | fraction of population susceptible to infection | The proportion of the population that is still susceptible to the disease.\nR0 | basic reproduction number | The average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a population where everyone is susceptible to the disease.\n\nThe text describes how different values of these parameters affect the basic reproduction number (R0) and the peak of the epidemic. For example, if \u03b5 is decreased (i.e., fewer individuals are susceptible to the disease), then R0 is also decreased, which can delay or reduce the peak of the epidemic. Similarly, if social-distancing measures are implemented, which reduce the infection and transmission rates (\u03b1 and \u03b2), then R0 is also reduced, which can anticipate or reduce the peak of the epidemic. Conversely, if social-distancing measures are not implemented or are only mildly effective, then R0 remains larger than 1, which can lead to a delayed and larger peak of the epidemic.\n\nTherefore, the variables and their descriptions are:\n\n\u03b1 | infection rate | The rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\n\u03b2 | transmission rate | The rate at which infected individuals transmit the disease to other susceptible individuals.\n\u03b3 | recovery rate | The rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune to the disease.\n\u03b4 | death rate | The rate at which infected individuals die from the disease.\n\u03b5 | fraction of population susceptible to infection | The proportion of the population that is still susceptible to the disease.\nR0 | basic reproduction number | The average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a population where everyone is susceptible to the disease."

In this case, the model is a mathematical model for the spread of a disease, and the parameter being varied is the transmission coefficient, denoted by \u03b4. The nominal value of \u03b4 is 0.0050. The text shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for six different values of \u03b4: 0.5\u03b4, 0.8\u03b4, \u03b4, 1.2\u03b4, 2\u03b4. The results are shown in terms of the total number of cases in the model. The text does not provide numerical values for the total number of cases for each value of \u03b4, only a graphical representation. Therefore, the total number of cases is listed as \"None\" for this analysis."
