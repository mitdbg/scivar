Likewise, Ohio is a state with marked variation of demographic and geographic attributes among counties along with substantial differences in the capacity of healthcare within the state. Our aim is to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation with the distribution of the capacity of healthcare in Ohio. 2. Methods 2.1. Mathematical model We developed a spatial mathematical model to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease infection and spread. The spatially-explicit model incorporates geographic connectivity information at county level. The Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered- Dead (SIHRD) COVID-19 model classified the population into susceptibles (S), confirmed infections (I), hospitalized and ICU admitted (H), recovered (R) and dead (D). Based on a previous study that identified local air hubs and main roads as important geospatial attributes lio residing in the county. In the second scenario, we used the model to generate projections of the impact of potential easing on the non-pharmaceutical interventions in the critical care capacity of each county in Ohio. We assessed the impact of 50% reduction on the estimated impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing the hazard rate of infection. Under this scenario we calculated the proportion of ICU ",

So far, the new virus has infected more than 31,000 people and killed at least 636 of them (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). While considerable progrenter of the current coronavirus outbreak, announced the implementation of travel restriction as strategy for controlling the infection. Following this announcement, many other cities and provinces ofChina decided to enforce similar measures. In the meantime, many other control measures have been adopted, like convincing all the residents to stay at home and avoid contacts as much as possible. From the mathematical point of view, this can significantly contribute to decreasing the contact rate c among the persons. On the other hand, also from January 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing numbers of 2019-nCoV testing kits were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, gradually shortening the time period of diagnosis (i.e. the value of dI increases greatly). Considering these control strategies, we adapted our previous model (Tang et al., 2020) as time-dependent dynamic system, by taking January 23rd, 2020 as the newly initial time: E \u00deI; S' \u00bc (cid:2)\u00f0bc\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe c\u00f0t\u00deq\u00f01 (cid:2) b\u00de\u00deS\u00f0I \u00fe qA\u00de \u00fe lSq; ' \u00bc bc\u00f0t\u00de\u00f01 (cid:2) q\u00deS\u00f0I \u00fe qA\u00de (cid:2) sE; ' \u00bc s9E (cid:2) \u00f0dI\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe a \u00fe gI I ' \u00bc s\u00f01 (cid:2) 9\u00deE (cid:2) gAA; A \u00bc \u00f01 (cid:2) b\u00dec\u00f0t\u00deqS\u00f0I \u00fe qA\u00de (cid:2) lSq; ' \u00bc bc\u00f0t\u00deqS\u00f0I \u00fe qA\u00de (cid:2) dqEq; E q H' \u00bc dI\u00f0t\u00deI \u00fe dqEq (cid:2) \u00f0a \u00fe gH R' \u00bc gII \u00fe gAA \u00fe gHH; \u00deH; ' q S Here, we assume that the contact rate c\u00f0t\u00de is a decreasing function with respect to time t, which is given by ",

Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, thereproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10). The basic reproduction number was also found to be associated with 0-folde2-fold increase in the reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistime when the number of confirmed cases reaches the maximum, so sustaining the intervention measures is critical. We repeated the procedure as above but fitted our model to the data of confirmed cases between January 23rd and February 1st, 2020 (Fig. 3) and observed the improved dI\u00f0t\u00de. As a result, in comparison with the results in Fig. 2, we obtained higher projected cumulative confirmed cases and delayed peak time.

Coenen2, David Demory1, 5,6, Chung-Yin Leung 1,4, Jonathan Dushoff 1,2, Guanlin Li2,4, The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 20201\u20134. Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our s type of interaction substitution is equivalent to assuming an effective contact rate ratio of 1 + \u03b1 for recovered individuals relative to the rest of the population.

This scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate IL s. It was simulated by randomly choosing agents A 1 with probability IL\u21900.5 to stay at home. Observing the results in Fig. 9, although the I t curve is flattened when compared with scenarios B and 4, it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3. Notice the D t still grows exponentially before reaching the peak. For the economic perspective, this scenario be- haves similarly to the baseline. These metrics offer evidence that IL\u21900.5 is not enough for effective epidemiological control, and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended. The impact of different isolation levels can be seen in Figs. 10 and 11, for IL \u2208 [0.3, 0.9], which represents the response of epi- demiological and economical curves for increasing IL. In Fig. 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve It flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown. Fig. 11 shows that as the value of IL increases, wealth loss of the A3 agents is higher, represented by W A 3 S,t curve, This scenario represents the pol- icy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing, but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agents. This scenario was implemented by reducing the contagion dis- tance\u03b21=0. 5 and the contagion rate \u03b22 = 0. 3 as the effect of us- ing masks and physical distancing. Fig. 12 shows a flatter I t curve when compared to scenario 5 while still keeping economic perfor- mance close",

We developed DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model for predicting detected cases and deaths in the prevaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model allows for underdetection of infections and effects of government interventions.We have applied DELPHI across more than 200 geographical areas since early April 2020 and recorded 6% and 11% two-week, out-of-sample median mean absolute percentage error on predicting cases and deaths, respectively. DELPHI compares favorably with other top COVID-19 epidemiological models and predicted in 2020 the large-scale epidemics in many areas, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia, months in advance. We further illustrate two downstream applications of DELPHI, enabled by the model's flexible parametric formulation of the effect of government interventions. First, we quantify the impact of government interventions on the pandemic's spread. We predict, that in the absence of any interventions, more than 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17, 2020, whereas 280,000 deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world had started one week earlier. Furthermore, we find that mass gathering restrictions and school closings were associated with the largest average reductions in infection rates at 29:9 6 6:9% and 17:3 6 6:7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay at home, was associated with an average reduction in infection rate by 74:4 6 3:7% from baseline across countries that implemented it. In the second appl",

By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)\u00b5 from the transition rates in the decline of infection rate. The exponential term models a potential resurgence in cases, for instance, due to premature relaxation of societal restrictions or some change in behavior.

Modeling Effect of Increasing Government Response As shown in Figure 2, DELPHI models different phases for the government response during a pandemic by means of the area-specific function \u03b3(t) for other reasons (e.g., to avoid losing time from work). Although in reality, the likelihood that a patient will be identified through testing varies across areas and over time, DEL- PHI treats the probability of detection, pd, as a global constant nuisance parameter. The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents average estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area. The model has enough degre",

Western European countries such as Switzerland, Spain, and Italy, which had some of the first and steepest outbreaks outside Asia, would have benefited the most. Cumulatively across the world, DELPHI predicts that more than 280,000 deaths or 68% of total deaths could have been avoided by May 17 with just a week's earlier start candidate sites (countries with high anticipated incidence and prevalence) to maximize the trial's statistical power. Specifically, suppose that we are considering shifting from policy i to j < i at time tc in some area that has not yet experienced a resurgence ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0).

The basic reproduction rate, R0, for the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for the first wave of COVID-19 was estimated to be between 2.5 and 3.0 (Liu et al. 2020a, Zhang et al. 2020). R0 measures on average how many new infections one infected patient will generate over the course of their disease in a fully susceptible population (i.e., in the beginning of the epidemic and, approximately, during the first wave). Thebasic reproduction rate R0 is proportional to \u03b3(0), and the effective reproduction rate Rt, its counterpart for t > 0, is proportional to \u03b3(t).

Covasim can also model the effect of comorbidities, which act by modifying an individual's probability of developing severe symptoms (and hence critical symptoms and death).

Age-linked disease susceptibility, progression, and mortality probabilities. Key: rsus: relative susceptibility to infection; psym: probability of developing symptoms; psev: probability of developing severe symptoms (i.e., sufficient to justify hospitalization); pcri: probability of developing into a critical case (i.e., sufficient to require ICU); pdea: probability of death (i.e., infection fatality ratio). Relative susceptibility values are derived from odds ratios presented in Zhang et al. [47]. Mortality rates are based on O'Driscoll et al. [50], which did not differentiate 80\u201389 and 90+. Values were validated from model fits to data on numbers of cases, numbers of people hospitalized and in intensive care, and numbers of deaths from Washington and Oregon states. Note that \"overall\" values depend on the age structure of the population being modeled. For a population like the USA or UK, the symptomatic proportion is roughly 70%, while for populations skewed towards younger ages, this proportion is lower.

For example, several methods are implemented to compute the effective reproduction number Re. Numerous definitions of Re exist; in standard SIR modeling, the most common definition (\"method 1\") is [72]: Re \u00e0 R0S=N where R0 is the basic reproduction number, S is the number of susceptibles, and N is the total population size. However, with respect to COVID-19, many authors instead define Re to include the effects of interventions, due to the implications that Re = 1 has for epidemic control. A second common definition of Re (\"method 2\") is to first determine the total number of people who became infectious on day t, then count the total number of people these pe compared.

The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R0. The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge\u2013Kutta methods. Results: We found an R0of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures. Results after simulating various scenarios indicate that disregarding social distancing androme coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan[1], a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic[2]. *Correspondence: smusili@jkuat.ac.ke1 School of Mathematical Sciences, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya Full list of author information is available at the end of the article The objective of this s",

A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can characterization in 1965 [2], three major, large-scale outbreaks have occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely, the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in mainland China [3], the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [4,5] and the MERS outbreak in 2015 in South J.

In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three\u2013four generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4. Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision- and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak m",

The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4). Two other scenarios looked at mild restrictions from the start (25%) or relaxation of restrictions before summer (to 30%); both predicted a rapidly increasing epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively).

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 inWuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.

Lastly, the quarantine measures are widely implemented, and the quarantined have a lower chance to infect the susceptible individuals. This is critical for controlling the spread across China. The can directly observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data.

Some countries, such as, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the detection method and has a delay between the real infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used to model the flows of people between four possible states: S=S\u00f0t\u00de, the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U \u00f0t\u00de, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=Q\u00f0t\u00de, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=C\u00f0t\u00de, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics. Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable I\u00f0t\u00de=U \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe Q\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe C\u00f0t\u00de, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals at time t. The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C=I is less than 1 and time-varying. R, the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system. The model comprises the following independent parameters: \u03b1 is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined infected per day. \u03b1\u2208[0,1\u00de. g1 is the quarantine rate for an un-quarantined infected \u2208[0,1].

The COVID- 19 pandemic is considered as the biggest global threat world- wide because of thousands of confirmed 3.1, we compute the 0 of the COVID-19 system model; in basic reproduction number R Section 3.2, we study the local stability of the disease free equi- librium in terms of R 0.

The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, ( N, 0, 0 < 1 and unstable 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally asymptotically stable if R if R 0>1. Next we investigate the sensitiveness of the COVID-19 model (1), with respect to the variation of each one of its parameters, for the endemic threshold (4). 4. Sensitivity analysis As we saw in Secters can be found, e.g., in Aguilar et al. [19]. Note that the sensitivity index may depend on several param- eters of the system, but also can be constant, independent of any parameter. For example, \u03d2 R 0 \u03b8 = +1 means that increasing (decreas- ing) \u03b8 by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R 0 by that same percentage. The estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done, since a small ",

The starting point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities informed about the new virus [20], with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease. Only on January 20, we have the report [21], with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7, re- spectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5]. We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be pre- cise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020). The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a restriction of movements of in- dividuals due to quarantine in the city. As a consequence, there was a limitation on the spread of the disease. In agreement, in our model we consider, as the total population under study, N= 110 0 0 0 0 0 / 250. This denominator has been determined in the first days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value: according to the real data published by the WHO, it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individu- als. As for the initial conditions, the following values have been fixed: S 0 = N \u2212 6, E 0 = 0, I 0 = 1, P 0 = 5, A 0 = 0, H 0=0, R 0 = 0, and F 0 = 0.

The dashed lines represent the 95% prediction intervals for the time course of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after lockdown (c) and (d). Day 0 in simulations is set at January 21, 2020. At the time of this manuscript, the consensus among medical experts is that the basic reproduction number R 0 near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is around 2. Our result in Fig. 4 (b) is comparable with earlier estimates and the current consensus. It also shows that, even without the more restrictive control measures in Wuhan undertaken after February 7, the lockdown and travel restrictions in the city had slowed down the transmission and reduced the basic reproduction number to a control reproduction number R c with a mean value 1.629. We will estimate the impact of the more restrictive control measures in Section 6.

In Fig. 6 (a), we see that a combination of a 10% reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90% increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks, force the newly diagnosed cases to decline, and significantly shorten the duration of the epidemic. 7. Potential of a second outbreak in Wuhan after the return-to-work With newly diagnosed cases on the decline in Wuhan and other cities in China since February 14, an urgent task for the authorities is to decide when to allow people to go back to work. Without lifting the ban on traffic in and out of the city, we tested three hypotheses of allowing people to rex models may not necessarily be more reliable in making predictions due to the larger number of model parameters to be estimated. Using a simple SIR model and the dataset of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan for model calibration, we demonstrated that there is a linkage between the transmission rate b and the case-infection ratio r, which resulted in a continuum of best-fit parameter values, which can produce significantly different model predictions of the epidemic.

[5] Here, Ic(t) is the cumulative number of infections that have occurred up to time t, and N is the total population size. This version of the branching process model, referred to as HawkesN, represents a stochastic version of the SIR model; with large R, the results of HawkesN are essentially deterministic. When projecting, we use our estimated R(ti ) at the last known point for all times going forward. Since the Nt term is the number of infections, if our estimates for R(ti ) are based on mortality numbers, we must also choose a mortality rate to interpolate between the two counts; although existing estimated rates vary significantly, we choos including spread of Ebola (26), retaliatory gang crimes (27), and email traffic (28, 29).

Here, the dimensionless reproduction number, R(t), evolves in time (18, 30\u201333) to reflect changes in disease reproduction in response to public health interventions (e.g., school closings, social distancing, closures of nonessential businesses, isolation, and quarantine). The distribution of interevent times w (ti \u2212 tj ) is a gamma or Weibull distribution (11, 33, 34) with shape parameter k and scale parameter b. Finally, theparameter \u00b5 allows for exogenous infection cases. The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximation to the common SIR model of infectious diseases (described later) during the initial phase of an epidemic when the total number of infections is small c",

The distribution of interevent times w (ti \u2212 tj ) is a gamma or Weibull distribution (11, 33, 34) with shape parameter k and scale parameter b. Finally, the parameter \u00b5 allows for exogenous infection cases. The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximancing measures, including bans on public events, school closures, and quarantine and isolation measures. The SIR model can be fit to the predictions made in ref. 3 for agent-based simulations of the United States. The SIR model assumes a population of size N where S is the total number of susceptible individuals, I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of resistant individuals. For simplicity of modeling, we view deaths as a subset of resistant individuals, and deaths can be estimated from the dynamics of R; this is reasonable for a disease with a relatively small death rared with the overall population size (35). Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti \u2212 tj )/\u03bb(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. The dynamic reproduction number R(t)can then be estimated via expectation\u2013maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (35): \u03bbh (t) = (1 \u2212 Ic(t)/N )(\u00b5 + (cid:88) k =1 rk 1{t \u2208 Ik }.

The reproduction number, rk, in each interval k is determined by rk = (cid:88) ti >tj pij 1{tj \u2208 Ik }/Nk, [4] where Nk is the total number of events in interval k.

Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti \u2212 tj )/\u03bb(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. The dynamic reproduction number R(t) can then be estimated via expectation\u2013maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (17) using an expectation\u2013maximization algorithm (18). Public health measures undertaken in China appear to have reduced R(t) to below the self-sustaining level of R = 1 by the middle of February. In Italy, public health measures brought the local value of R(t) down; as of early April, however, it remained above R = 1. The estimated reproduction number in the United States as a whole stood at around 2.5. The reproduction number, however, varies notably by location. This model can be adapted to capture the long-ter California and Indiana, possibly due to the larger amount of data, compared with mortality for which SIR is the best for all three states. The branching process performs best for confirmed cases in New York. Our choice of fitting follows the method in ref. 43 for the 1918 pandemic death data.

The value r\u221e satisfies a well-known transcendental equation (46\u201348). A phase diagram of the universal solutions for several R0 values is shown in Fig. 2, Upper Right. The dynamics start in the bottom right corner where s is almost 1 and follow the colored line to terminate on the i = 0 axis at the value s\u221e. A rigorous derivation of the limiting state under the assumptions here can be found in refs. 46\u201348. Under the SIR (and similar) model(s), if R0 is decreased during the middle of the population. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we present scenarios of no social distancing vs. short-term social distancing with parameters from Table 1 for death data up through the end of March, fit to the SIR model. We caution that the goal of these scenarios is not to produce highly accurate percentages but rather, to present scenarios under different basic assumptions that illustrate the usefulness of social distancing measures and the potential danger in easing them too soon. For the New York state scenario, with R0 presumed to decrease by a factor of two with distancing measures, the outbreak is not completely controlled by distancing, and the number of infections continues to rise to approximately 10% by mid-April. In contrast, without distancing measures the scenario shows four times that number of infected individuals by midApril, a level that would have represented a potentially disastrous Bertozzi et al.

Integrating this, we see that Ic likewise grows exponentially with the same rate \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3. An important observation is that the doubling time for cumulative infections [Td = ln(2)/\u03b1] will change during the early times, with a shorter doubling time when t (cid:28) 1/\u03b3 and a longer doubling time when t > 1/\u03b3.

For morality rates in the range of 0.3 to 3%, the peak date changes by up to 2 wk. Data quality is an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lack of uniform testing. Uncertainty in estimates of the total number infected leads to uncertainty peak date and total infected.

Figure 1 shows an example of such logistic function, where for the case of Singapore, we set t0 = 89, since the policy of compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case was uncovered. This model is used in both Scenarios 1 and 3. Figure 1. Logistic function to model the infection rate due to compulsory mask wearing m(t) for Scenarios 1 and 3. To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = \u03b2s \u2212 \u03b2c 1 + e\u2212k1(\u2212t+t0) + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2nc 1 + e\u2212k2(\u2212t+t1) + \u03b2nc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, \u03b2nc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from \u03b2c \u2192 \u03b2nc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy. Figure 2 illustrates one such example, where we have \u03b2nc = 0.5 and t1 = 154, taken in context to Singapore's shift from a full lockdown to gradual resumption of everyday activities 154 days after the first case. The infection rate \u03b2nc is expected to be lower than \u03b2s as even with the complacency and fatigue, as there is now a greater situational awareness of the severity and the population in general will take a more cautious outloo",

Relating this to Singapore's context, compulsory mask wearing was introduced 89 days after the first case, hence this suggests that the introduction of compulsory mask wearing was timely to control the infection. Crucially, onder approximately 50 days. It is likely that for such cases of early enforcement, the Susceptible population remains very high throughout. Consequently, when the agents begin to flout the rules aftert1 = 154 days, the combination of both larger Susceptible compartment pool and higher \u03b2nc results in a greater amount of infection. In other words, the susceptible population must be sufficiently reduced before th gradual noncompliance. At the time the initial study was conducted, we had modelled the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and its response to the initial strain of virus that was first detected at thestart of 2020.

B117 strained virus has acquired the D614G spike protein mutation, reportedly increasing its infectivity, with little difference to its lethality [24]. According to studies done in the UK, the R0 value of B117 has increased by up to 0.7 [25]. To investigate the impact of delay in public mask enforcement on controlling the Maximum Infected Numbers due to the B117 variant, we modelled a hypothetical scenario. In this scenario, the first case of COVID-19 detected in Singapore is of the B117 variant. We ran our simulation of the 3 scenarios described in the preceding sections with a new value of R0 reflecting that of B117. The resulting plots are shown in Figure 6 and 7. Finitially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states.

As we are near the peak of new cases at current isolation levels, estimated to be between the beginning and the middle of June, increasing the isolation levels does not significantly impact when the peak occurs or its magnitude. However, the disease spreading and the occurrences of new cases decrease much faster in this scenario than in any other situation studied here, with a difference of months. Moreover, the final numbers are considerably smaller, with an average of 552,855 diagnosed cases (up to 2.1 million infected) 87,059 deaths until the end of the year.

According to our estimations, five countries have reached a second phase with R0 < 1, meaning that the epidemic is under control and converging to an equilibrium. On the other hand, the USA have also reached a second stage with a lower R0, but still higher than 1, indicating that the number of infections is decelerating but is not under control yet. A \u03b4I value higher than \u03b4H was to be expected, indicating a lower rate of mortality in hospitalized patients. However, that was observed only in the USA. In the other countries in this study, the value of \u03b4H is higher or very similar to the value of \u03b4I. In these cases, this behavior might be justified by the most critical cases being treated in the hospitals, therefore being associated to a higher mortality rate. It is interesting to remark that the predictions of the number of deceased in Germany in Fig 6 and the USA in Fig 7 presented a larger mismatch both as compared to the other countries as well as compared to the number of cases within Germany and the USA themselves. Just as social distancing, more careful hygiene and other such measures can reduce the transmissibility, it might be expected that the development of protocols for treatments using the kn",

Indeed, the contact patterns in most states of the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York. In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada, Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York.

The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the new infections are dominated by the Delta variant. These predictions are consistent with Ontario statistics (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). The consistency between model predictions and Ontario statistics before July 2021 can be attributed to the choice of model parameters, which were based on statistics available then. Model predictions for the second half of 2021 can be used to validation. The total number of infectely half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig. 3d\u2013g).

The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the interactions and competition shown in Fig. 2b. The model predicts that by the end of 2021, about 680 K people would have been infected, half of whom are asymptomatic. The cumulative infection curves exhibit the steepest rise in December 2020 and March 2021, corresponding to the two peaks in the new case counts. By the end of 2021, 71% of the Ontario population would have been vaccinated with at least one dose, with 57% fully vaccinated (Fig. 2c). At that time, 11 K would have died from COVID, with 36, 47, and 17% from wild type, Alpha, and Delta, respectively (Fig. 2d). The year-end infection and death statistics are within 10% of reported data in Ontario (750 K infections and 10.2 K deaths)16. Predicted population dynamics are shown in Fig. 3. The drop in the susceptible population becomes significant after December 2020 (Fig. 3a) and is driven primarily by the vaccine deployment. By the end of June 2021, only 37% of the Ontario population are susceptible, with the majority having received at least one dose of vaccine (Fig. 3b,c). The number of active infections peaks at the end of 2020, followed by an even higher peak at the end of spring (Fig. 3d). These are the wild-type and Alpha-driven waves identified in Fig. 2a and described above. The Alpha-driven infection peak accounts for",

The Alpha and Delta strains are not included. We assume that NPI begin on March 1 2020, with the restrictiveness index \u03bb taken to be uniformly 0.5 (i.e., infectivity \u03b2's halved) for simplicity. Vaccination begins on April 1 2020 (not the end of 2020, for this simplified one-year simulation), with baseline dosing interval taken to be 4 weeks for Pfizer and 8 weeks for AstraZeneca (dosing interval is one of the parameters varied include those that describe the clinical features of the viruses as well as provincial policy and pharmaceutical intervention. Clinical features of the viruses that were considered include its infectivity (\u03b2W), the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic (\u03c3W), the infectivity ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (\u03b1W), mortality rate (\u03bcW), and recovery rates (\u03b3WA and \u03b3WI, varied simultaneously). Recall the baseline assumption that asymptomatic individuals are assumed to be more active and 3 times more likely to spread the disease than symptomatic ones (\u03b1W = 3). Thus, the number of infections directly depends on, and is in fact highly sensitive to, \u03b2W, \u03c3W, \u03b1W, and also to the recovery rate \u03b3W, which impacts how many new infections an infected individual can Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 3 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

The baseline model simulation describes what happened in Ontario: that after its introduction at the beginning of 2021, the number of new Delta cases peaked in April, before it was suppressed by the provincial lockdown that began on April 13. Simulation predicts that provided that some significant NPI remain in place throughout the remainder of 2021 and 2022 (\u03bb \u2264 0.4, except during the winter holidays), the Delta variant may remain under control.

Thus, we consider a scenario with less stringent NPI starting from the fall of 2021 (September 1 2021), with \u03bb increased from its baseline value of 0.4 Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 7 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

Results suggest that wild type limits the spread of Alpha; wild type and Alpha together limit Delta. to 0.5 onwards. The model predicts the reduced NPI would accelerate the spread of Delta, such that by March 2022, the total number of Delta infections would be 50% higher than baseline (Fig. 7b). Who are getting infected by the Delta variant, and who are the carriers? Interestingly, while the wild-type infectio gain insights, we simulate a dangerous hypothetical variant, which we refer to as \"Neos.\" Neos is designed to be deadlier by increasing its (i) infectivity (14% higher than the Delta variant), (ii) vaccine escape rate (70% for one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca, similar to Delta which is 67%; 25% and 50% for two doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, respectively; compared to 12% and 40% for Delta), and (iii) fraction of asymptomatic infections (55% instead of 50%). Recovery rate, mortality rate, and other clinical features are assumed to be the same as the wild type. We assume that Neos emerges in the fall of 2021. The predicted population dynamics that describe its spread, from August 1 2021 to June 30 2022, is shown in Fig. 9. After its introduction, Neos quickly takes hold due to its high transmissivity, and by the end of 2021, it has overtaken Delta to account for the majority of new infections (Fig. 9c). By mid 2022, the infected individuals would account for 1% of the entire population (Fig. 9f), despite nearly 80% of the population having been vaccinated. More than 6.6 K would have died from Neos (Fig. 9g); th",

Results are obtained for three scenarios: (a1) more stringent NPI, with mobility decreased further by 40% starting September 1 2021; (b1) a third vaccine booster that offers twice the protection of health conditions. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity likely has a significant impact on the spread of infections. As can be seen in the geographical heterogeneity in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, socio-economic factors also play an important role in the local spread of COVID-19. These factors include the number of people per household, job locations, frequency of public transportation usage, regional vaccination rates, and social connectedness, etc. Different socio-economic groups are likely affected differently by the NPI. Thus, a worthwhile extension would be to divide Ontario into regions with distinct demographics, represent the spread of COVID-19 within each region using an incarnation of the SV2(AIR)3 model, and then loosely connect these sub-models based on the estimated amounts of communications mediated by job or social travels. The present model is formulated using data from Ontario, Canada (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Geographical and socio-economic parameters can be refitted to simulate VOC dynamics in a different province in Canada or a different country (e.g., infectivity \u03b2, vaccine type \u03b5, COVID-19 mortality rate \u03bcX, NPI \u03bb). These models can be a valuable decision-support tool for public health. Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 13 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientifi",

The SV2(AIR)3 model involves parameters that describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 VOC, which were estimated from published studies. Other parameters describe the demographics and social behaviors of the Ontario population, which were estimated from published provincial statistics. Parameters were then fine-tuned manually so that model predictions approximate the published number of new infections and deaths (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Baseline parameter values are shown in Table S1. Simulating NPI. As the number of COVID-19 rose, on March 23 2020 the Ontario government began a number of public health safety measures, which varied in severity over time, including stay-at-home orders, workplace safety measures, restrictions on public events and social gath",

Much of the total mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet stems from a small number of rapidly melting ice shelves; here, we focus on Pine Island Glacier, which is the source of a large fraction of the total mass loss (Rignot et al. 2019). The meltwater outflow from underneath the Pine Island ice shelf is concentrated in a narrow kilometer-scale flow a typical sub-iceshelf circulation (e.g., Grosfeld et al. 1997; Losch 2008). We investigate the dynamics of such a meltwater outflow by idealizing it as a prescribed, constant buoyancy source F, withwidth L, applied to the bottom of our model domain. In the real world, this buoyancy source is a function of complex melting and mixing processes beneath the ice shelf cavity; explicit consideration of these 1986; Helfrich and Battisti (1) (2) 1991; Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tom\u00e0s et al. 2016). As described, for example, by Speer and Marshall (1995), as long as N is substantially larger than the Coriolis parameter f, the only two parameters that could physically control the rise 23, consider an area-integrated buoyancy height are F (m4 s 21).

In the case of the glacial meltwater outflow, however, the meltwater plume dont), and on the mixing with ambient cavity water. It also depends on the nature of the sub-ice-shelf circulation, and to what extent this focuses the outflow into a narrow jet as is the case for the Pine Island ice shelf. While F/L could in principle be calculated using a sufficiently sophisticated subice-shelf model, our approach in this study will be to treat it primarily as a tunable parameter.

(a) A y\u2013z plane with x 5 0 (i.e., perpendicular to the ice shelf front) is depicted: arrows indicate the flow in this plane, while colors indicate the flow perpendicular to it. We see the development of a strong zonal flow, consistent with observations of the outflow from beneath the Pine Island ice shelf. (b) The zonally averaged meltwater distribution and (c) the meridionally averaged meltwater distribution are also depicted. Distributions have been normalized to integrate to 1. The meltwater outflow is deflected to the west by the Coriolis force, and eventually reenters the domain at the eastern boundary. Our model domain follows the schematic in Fig. 1. The horizontal widths Ly and Lx are both set to 5 km, while the depth of the ice shelf front Lz is set equal to 400 m (approximately consistent with Pine Island Glacier; see Jenkins et al. 2010). The domain is reentrant in the zonal x direction; free-shelf is represented as a constant buoyancy source F applied to a horizontal area of length L next to the southern edge of the domain (see Fig. 1). We conduct experiments both with varying L and with L set to a default value of 1 km, which is broadly consistent with the meltwater outflow from beneath Pine Island Glacier (Naveira Garabato et al. 2017). The buoyancy source F is implemented as a constant volumeconserving ''virtual salinity flux'' (Huang 1993; see appendix B for details). The Coriolis parameter f is setermining the plume's settling depth (e.g., Fabregat Tom\u00e0s et al. 2016; Naveira Garabato et al. 2017), we conduct two simulations: one where the Coriolis parameter f has a realistic 21, and one where f has been set to zero. value 21.4 3 10 The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4.

This effect is relatively unimportant compared to the role played by the buoyancy source per unit width (F/L) and ambient stratification (N):this can be inferred both from Fig. 2 and the rapid initial stratification-driven adjustment in Fig. 4, and is confirmed in the large-eddy simulations presented in the next section (Fig. 5). The effect emerges on the same time scale in which the meltwater flow reaches x 5 0 after having reentered from the eastern boundary (;1 day, see Fig. 3), and may thus also be a consequence of the idealized nature of the simulation setup.

We suggest that the difference in settling depths between our 2009 and 2014 simulations is a consequence of the N2 peak at around 350 m that was present in 2009 but not in2014: the meltwater was ''trapped'' by the local maximum in stratification. This illustrates an important point: localized variability in the ambient stratification N(z) can have a substantial effect on mass loss due to melt (see text). On top of the distributions we plot the settling depths predicted by the simple scaling relationships (dashed) and the one-dimensional line plume model (solid) with a 5 2.6: both show excellent agreement with the highresolution simulations. The new scaling relationships show substantial improvement over the scaling relationships for point source plumes [h } (F/N3)1/4]. For the scaling solution, we have used a 5 2.6: the good agreement with the simulation results indicates that the coefficient matches that for point source plumes (Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tom\u00e0s et al. 2016). c.

We assume that the vertical velocity w is uniform within the plume and zero outside, and that the plume is rising next to a wall (so that entrainment can only occur from one side). We can then write down volume, momentum, and mass conservation equations within the plume: d dz (Dw) 5 aw, d dz (Dwrw) 5 Dg(r 2 r), a d dz (Dwr) 5 awr a. (A1) (A2) (A3) Here, r(z) is the density of the plume, ra(z) is the ambient density, D is the width of the plume perpendicular to the wall, and a is the entrainment coefficient. Assuming that r(z) differs only slightly from the reference density r0, we can rewrite Eq.

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms.

Although anecdotal cases are found in the literature27, the reinfection rate value appears negligible. A detailed discussion of the model considerations and parameters is provided in the Methods. For the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we estimate the model parameters based on data from 20 February 2020 (day 1) to 5 April 2020 (day 46) and show how the progressive restrictions, including the most recent lockdown progressively enforced since 9 March 2020, have affected the spread of the epidemic.

We infer the model parameters based on the official data (source: Protezione Civile and Ministero della Salute) about the evolution of the epidemic in Italy from 20 February 2020 (day 1) through 5 April 2020 (day 46). The official data we gathered are provided in Supplementary Table 1. We turn the data into fractions over the whole Italian population (~60 million). The estimated parameter values are based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by policymakers. In particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set as: I = 200/60e6, D = 20/60e6, A = 1/60e6, R = 2/60e6, T = 0, H = 0, E = 0; S = 1 \u2013 I \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 T \u2013 H \u2013 E. The parameters are set as \u03b1 = 0.570, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.011, \u03b3 = 0.456, \u03b5 = 0.171, \u03b8 = 0.371, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.125, \u03bc = 0.017, \u03bd = 0.027, \u03c4 = 0.01, \u03bb = \u03c1 = 0.034 and \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. The resulting basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.38. After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one's face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set \u03b1 = 0.422, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.0057 and \u03b3 = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set \u03b5 = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence \u03b5 is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 \u03b1 = 0.360, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.005 and \u03b3 = 0.200; also, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.034, \u03bc = 0.008, \u03bd = 0.015, \u03bb = 0.08 and \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. Hence, the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.60. After day 28, the lockdown is ",

Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in the long term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when the initially affected population is a small fraction. Social-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions. Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment",
